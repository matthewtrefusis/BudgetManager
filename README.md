## Building the Application

The application's executable is not included in the repository due to GitHub's file size limitations. You can build it yourself using the following steps:

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or later

### Steps to Build a Self-Contained Executable

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/matthewtrefusis/BudgetManager.git
   cd BudgetManager
   ```

2. Build the self-contained executable:
   ```
   dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release --self-contained true /p:PublishSingleFile=true /p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true
   ```

3. The executable will be available at:
